# CPP_Neural_Network
This C++ implementation of a Neural Network implements a single hidden layer of 2 neurons and trains it to perfoorm the XOR function. The neural network uses
backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent to update the weights and biases of its neurons based on the error between the output of the network and the 
target values. After training, the program tests the neural network by evaluating its output for the input values '{0,0}', `{0,1}`, `{1,0}`, and `{1,1}`.
